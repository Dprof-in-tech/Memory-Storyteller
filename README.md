## üí´ About This Project

I built Memory Storyteller as a labor of love for my partner. This app allows me to preserve our special moments together and transform them into beautifully crafted stories that are automatically delivered to her WhatsApp.

Every relationship has its collection of precious memories - first dates, adventures, quiet moments, and milestones. Memory Storyteller helps me capture these moments in rich detail and turn them into romantic narratives that remind us both of the journey we're sharing.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Detailed Memory Capture**: Record every aspect of our memories including emotions, sensory details, and personal significance
- **AI-Powered Storytelling**: Transform raw memories into beautiful narrative stories using Claude AI or ChatGPT
- **WhatsApp Delivery**: Send stories directly to my love's phone to surprise her with cherished memories
- **Scheduled Surprises**: Plan deliveries for special dates like anniversaries and birthdays
- **Memory Collection**: Build a growing archive of our relationship journey together

## üíï Why I Made This

In the hustle of daily life, it's easy to forget the beautiful little moments that make a relationship special. I wanted to create something that would help us remember and celebrate our journey together.

There's something magical about receiving an unexpected message that brings a cherished memory to life. Memory Storyteller helps me give that gift to the person I love most in the world.
